## Before You Start

### Check Existing Issues First

Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please:

1. **Browse the [Issues tab](https://github.com/8starlabs/ui/issues)** to see if there's already:
   - 🐛 **Bug Report** - Someone has reported the issue you want to fix
   - ✨ **Feature Request** - The component or feature you want to add has been requested
   - 🔒 **Report a Security Vulnerability** - Please review our [security policy](https://github.com/8starlabs/ui/security) for more details

2. **Look for issues labeled:**
   - `help wanted` - We're actively seeking contributors
   - `bug` - Confirmed bugs that need fixing

3. **If you find a relevant issue:**
   - Comment on it to let others know you're working on it
   - Ask questions if you need clarification
   - Reference the issue number in your PR

4. **If no issue exists:**
   - **For bugs:** Create a bug report with reproduction steps
   - **For features:** Open a feature request or discussion first

This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's goals.
