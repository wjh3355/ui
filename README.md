# 8starlabs UI

[8StarLabs UI](https://ui.8starlabs.com) is a component library built on top of shadcn/ui to help you build modern, interactive, and unique interfaces faster.

## Overview

8starlabs UI provides pre-built, reusable React components specifically designed for dashboards, developer tools, and interactive applications, including:

- Status indicators (pulsing system dots, activity signals)
- Transport badges (MRT, bus, and other transit symbols)
- Developer banners (CLI banners, dev alerts, labels)

The library integrates seamlessly with Next.js projects using shadcn/ui and provides a simple CLI for adding components to your project.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.elevenlabs.io/r/transport-badge.json
```

All available components can be found [here](https://ui.8starlabs.com/docs/components).

## Prerequisites
